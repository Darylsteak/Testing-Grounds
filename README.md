# Testing_Grounds
This is my github page for the project I am doing following the [Unreal Engine 4 course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-c-developer-archived-course/) done by Ben Tristem and Sam Pattuzzi.

## The_Design
Basic gameplay and overview:
- Need to go through "testing grounds" (levels), with enemy guards patrolling. 
- Final score is determined by how many you got through.
- You can sneak or blast through level
- If caught, testing ground will be locked down and you will need to kill everyone to reopen it
- Intend to be Sci Fi setting

## Intended features to be added after the course is finished:
- Add a physical door, make them actual large rooms
- Add a hacking system to get past the lock down, and you can hide from guards and escape    them, resetting them back to patrol state. A la MGS
- More weapons, and limited ammo system
